Concepts:
	* Dynamically typed (although Haskell's type system is to die for, maybe both?)
	* Lists as main constructs
	* Consistent function and variable naming (meta)
	* (type) casting if it's needed (C# does some things right!)
	* function argument-syntax like in Haskell
	* NO HUNGARIAN NOTATION WHATSOEVER! (I'm looking at you PHP!)
